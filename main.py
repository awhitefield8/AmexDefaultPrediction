"""
This code base is for the Amex Default prediction Kaggle competition

We are exploring two different ways of predicting this data, boosting models and deep learning. Rajas will be handling
the boosting algorithms, with specific focus on distributed learning. Jordan and Alex will be looking into Transformer
architectures.

Key to this analysis is gracefully handling the size of the data. Pushkar will be analyzing dimension reduction
techniques and sampling of the data to allow for faster training and inference.
